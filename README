Project #1
Description: This project modifies Dr. Tehranipour's existing program TCPServer.java and TCPClient.java. The project
    creates a simple server-client relationship. The TCPServer gets started first and then TCPClient connects to the
    server. The client sends messages to the server. The server then sends the client back the number of messages it
    received, a log of the client's messages, and the duration of the connection.

How to compile and run program: Simply compile ana_TCPClient.java and ana_TCPServer.java using javac in a terminal
    or using the built in compiler in an IDE. Run the program using java and the respective class names that are
    generated after compilation. It is important to run the server first and then the client. Make sure you give the
    port number to the server program otherwise it assumes port number 20750 and similarly give the server's host
    address and port number to the client program using command line arguments -h and -p otherwise it assumes the
    server program is on the localhost at port 20750.

*Conclusion*
    Time: 5 hours
    Difficulties: Figuring out how to send information from server to client (not a BIG difficulty just had to think
        about it).
    Bugs: No bugs that I know of. Client and server program should behave as expected as long as the user inputs are
        valid (no error checking).
